PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Project Grade: A
Completed: 05/03/2021
this program is a simulation of 40 years of making either smart financial decisions vs. 40 years of making not smart financial decisions.

This program accomplishes this by creating two objects that behave as people who make financial decisions. There are also functions that simulate the persons financial decisions such as debt functions, a house function that simulates mortgage payments, a savings function that simulates how someone saves money, a rent function to simulate renting an apartment, and a simulate function that runs 40 years of financial decisions.


DIRECTIONS
first: compile the project in accordance with C protocols
    enter this on the command line to compile: gcc FinancialSimulation.c -o FinancialSimulation
second: run the program with the correct command line arguments
    enter this on the command line to run: ./FinancialSimulation  output_fl.txt output_nfl.txt

LIMITATIONS
this is an extremely simplified simulation of what impact various financial decisions have on a persons life. This does not take into account
events that are out of a persons control such as getting promoted or getting fired from a job. This should not be used as a means of
determining what decisions someone should make. Those should be made with a qualified financial advisor. A more sophisticated simulation
could perhaps include other possible decisions that someone could make.
